This repository demonstrates an uncommon behavior in HTML related to accessing non-existent attributes and properties.  Accessing a non-existent attribute using getAttribute() returns undefined without throwing an error.  Conversely, accessing a non-existent property throws a TypeError in strict mode. This difference can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to debug.  The bug.html file showcases the problem, and bugSolution.html offers a solution demonstrating best practice for handling such scenarios.
